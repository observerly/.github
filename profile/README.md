üî≠ observerly is a first-in-class remote observational platform built for the web, built for amateur astronomers, and built for you.

We aim to make it as easy and intuitive as possible to schedule, create and share your observations with the world, and to discover the observations of others. We're building observerly as a remote observation deck, where you can view the universe from the comfort of your own home - connecting to your own equipment, the equipment of others, or our remote network of world-class telescopes.

Our remote network of telescopes includes locations in the United States, Australia, Spain, Chile and Namibia, with more locations coming soon. We're also working on a mobile app for iOS and Android, so you can take observerly with you wherever you go.
